# WARNING
These are the ONLY eggs that will be produced in PTDL_v1. If you are on 1.7.x or lower *(as far as I know)*, you will be able to use these eggs. I am no longer producing eggs in PTDL_v1. All my eggs from this point forward will only be compatable with PTDL_v2. *1.8.x+*

If you need the eggs for PTDL_v2, check one directory back, and the PTDL_v2 folder.
